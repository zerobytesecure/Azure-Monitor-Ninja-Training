# Module 1: Technical Overview

Note: If you want to get an initial overview of Azure Monitor technical capabilities. The presentation also serves as the Azure Monitor Level 200 presentation

Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your applications and services by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.

Just a few examples of what you can do with Azure Monitor include:

* Detect and diagnose issues across applications and dependencies with Application Insights.

* Correlate infrastructure issues with Azure Monitor for VMs and Azure Monitor for Containers.

* Drill into your monitoring data with Log Analytics for troubleshooting and deep diagnostics.

* Support operations at scale with smart alerts and automated actions.

* Create visualizations with Azure dashboards and workbooks.

The following diagram gives a high-level view of Azure Monitor. At the center of the diagram are the data stores for metrics and logs, which are the two fundamental types of data used by Azure Monitor. 

On the left are the sources of monitoring data that populate these data stores. 

On the right are the different functions that Azure Monitor performs with this collected data such as analysis, alerting, and streaming to external systems.
