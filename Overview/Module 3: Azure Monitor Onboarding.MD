# Module 3: Azure Monitor Onboarding 

Enabling Azure Monitor to monitor of all your Azure resources is a combination of configuring Azure Monitor components and configuring Azure resources to generate monitoring data for Azure Monitor to collect. 

This article describes the different steps required for a complete implementation of Azure Monitor using a common configuration to monitor all of the resources in your Azure subscription. Basic descriptions for each step are provided with links to other documentation for detailed configuration requirements.

__Configuration goals__ - The goal of a complete implementation of Azure Monitor is to collect all available data from all of your cloud resources and applications and enable as many features in Azure Monitor as possible based on that data.

__No configuration__ - The following features of Azure Monitor are enabled with no configuration required when you create an Azure subscription. There is no cost associated with this monitoring.

__Collect data from Azure resources__ - Some monitoring of Azure resources is available automatically with no configuration required, while you must perform configuration steps to collect additional monitoring data.
