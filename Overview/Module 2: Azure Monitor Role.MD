# Module 2: Azure Monitor Role

Note: Azure Monitor level 200: what are the typical use for Azure Sentinel? What are customers finding in it, and also, how is it priced

Microsoft Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. Itâ€™s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

The goal of a complete implementation of Azure Monitor is to collect all available data from all of your cloud resources and applications and enable as many features in Azure Monitor as possible based on that data. Data collected by Azure Monitor is sent to either Azure Monitor Metrics or Azure Monitor Logs.
