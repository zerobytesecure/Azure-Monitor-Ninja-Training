# LAB 1: Application Insights Monitoring

Application Insights comes as part of Visual Studio. You get automatic instrumentation for ASP.NET developers and vital application telemetry data right out of the box; including usage, exceptions, requests, performance, and logs.

Monitor web apps—whether written in Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, Node.JS, or other languages—using open source SDKs. Install the Status Monitor on your existing Azure App Services and virtual machines through the Azure portal to get performance monitoring without needing to update and redeploy your application.

Visual Studio Application Insights is an extensible analytics service that monitors your live web application. With it you can detect and diagnose performance issues, and understand what users actually do with your app. It’s designed for developers, to help you continuously improve performance and usability. It works for apps on a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js and J2EE, hosted on-premises or in the cloud.

It provides benefits as:

Exceptions and performance diagnostics
Interactive data analysis
Azure diagnostics
Proactive detection
