# LAB 3: Azure Monitor  Management

This lab guide walks the user through a number of management and monitoring solutions within Microsoft Azure. Azure has a wide range of tools available for monitoring your cloud environment, as well as identifying and resolving issues. This lab guide will focus on the following areas:

* Azure Monitor - a tool for consolidating all monitoring data from Azure services.

* Log Analytics - a service that ingests log and metric data from Azure services and on-premises infrastructure and offers flexible log search and out-of-the-box analytics.

* Application Insights - offers application performance monitoring and user analytics through the monitoring of code running on Azure, on-premises or other clouds.

Before proceeding with this lab, please make sure you have fulfilled all of the following prerequisites:

* A valid subscription to Azure. If you don't currently have a subscription, consider setting up a free trial (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/).

* Access to the Azure CLI 2.0. You can achieve this in one of two ways: either by installing the CLI on your local machine (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), or by using the built-in Cloud Shell in the Azure portal - you can access this by clicking on the ">_" symbol in the top right corner of the portal.
