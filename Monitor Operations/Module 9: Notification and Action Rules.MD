# Module 9: Notification and Action Rules

Action rules help you define or suppress actions at any Azure Resource Manager scope (Azure subscription, resource group, or target resource).

They have various filters that help you narrow down the specific subset of alert instances that you want to act on.

Azure Monitor action groups enable you to define a list of actions to execute when an alert is triggered.

In this episode, we demonstrate how to configure a Service Health alert to use an action group
