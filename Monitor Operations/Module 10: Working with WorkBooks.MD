# Module 10: Working with WorkBooks

Azure Workbooks is a service which allows to build reports using text (in markdown) and a number of data visualization types (tables, charts, tiles, etc…). 

The data can come from various sources (logs, metrics, alerts, etc…) and is obtained using KQL queries.

Workbooks provide a flexible canvas for data analysis and the creation of rich visual reports within the Azure portal. 

They allow you to tap into multiple data sources from across Azure, and combine them into unified interactive experiences.
