# Module 7: Monitor DevOps and Application

Azure Monitor is the unified monitoring solution in Azure that provides full-stack observability across applications and infrastructure in the cloud and on-premises. 

It works seamlessly with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code during development and test and integrates with Azure DevOps for release management and work item management during deployment and operations. 

It even integrates across the ITSM and SIEM tools of your choice to help track issues and incidents within your existing IT processes.

Azure Monitor supports popular languages and frameworks, such as .NET, Java and Node.js and integrates with DevOps processes and tools like Azure DevOps, Jira and PagerDuty. 

Track live metrics streams, requests and response times and events.
