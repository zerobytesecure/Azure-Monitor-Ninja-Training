# Module 4: Architecture and Planning

As you undergo your digital transformation to the cloud, it's important that you plan and develop an effective cloud monitoring strategy with participation of developers, operations staff, and infrastructure engineers. 

The strategy should be growth-oriented, defined minimally, then refined iteratively; always aligned with business needs. Its outcome delivers an agile operations modality centered around the ability of the organization to proactively monitor complex distributed applications the business depends on.

Monitoring for scalability should be part of your overall monitoring strategy that utilizes Azure Monitor. 

The overall monitoring strategy should take into consideration not only scalability, but resiliency (infrastructure, application, and dependent services) and application performance as well. 

Most services in Azure offer the ability to turn on both data and management plane logs as well as metrics. For purposes of scalability, looking at the metrics would allow you to scale based scale up, scale out, scale in, and scale down. The ability to scale dynamically is one of the biggest values of moving to the cloud.
