# Module 6: Log Management

Azure Monitor stores log data in a Log Analytics workspace, which is an Azure resource and a container where data is collected, aggregated, and serves as an administrative boundary.

While you can deploy one or more workspaces in your Azure subscription, there are several considerations you should understand in order to ensure your initial deployment is following our guidelines to provide you with a cost effective, manageable, and scalable deployment meeting your organizations needs.
